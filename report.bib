pages="259--277",
abstract="A new high-fidelity Cessna II simulation model is developed that is valid throughout the normal, pre-stall flight envelope. From an extensive collection of flight test data, aerodynamic model identification was performed using the Two-Step Method. New in this approach is the use of the Unscented Kalman Filter for an improved accuracy and robustness of the state estimation step. Also, for the first time an explicit data-driven model structure selection is presented for the Citation II by making use of an orthogonal regression scheme. This procedure has indicated that most of the six non-dimensional forces and moments can be parametrized sufficiently by a linear model structure. It was shown that only the translational and lateral aerodynamic force models would benefit from the addition of higher order terms, more specifically the squared angle of attack and angle of sideslip. The newly identified aerodynamic model was implemented into an upgraded version of the existing simulation framework and will serve as a basis for the integration of a stall and post-stall model.",
