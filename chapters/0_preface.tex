\chapter{Preface}

In this report I explain the work I did during my internship at DAWN Aerospace. The founders of the company are all former member of Delft Aerospace Rocket Engineering (DARE) who have decided to continuo working on rocket propulsion systems after their studies and thus DAWN is an aerospace company whose ultimate goal is to develop reusable rocket systems. I have been myself a member of DARE for the past few years and have actually worked with the founders of DAWN during the Stratos II and Stratos II+ projects. Which is why I wanted to do my internship there. I would like to give a special thanks to Tobais Knop, Jeroen Wink and everyone else there for the opportunity to be part of DAWN for the past few months.
