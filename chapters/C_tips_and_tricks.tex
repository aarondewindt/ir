\chapter{Tips \& tricks for future interns}

At the end, the internship did mostly go as expected. Since it is still a small startup and I have worked with the guys at DAWN before, I kind of knew what to expect. The main tip I can give to any future interns is that they will need to know or at least learn fast on how to work independently and how to manage them selves. It's not like they will be left alone to work on their own, but there is definitely less support compared to university assignments. 
The reason I decided to go to DAWN is because I had already been quite interested in the project for a while and I had already worked with the guys at DAWN when they where still members at DARE. Since it is located in Delft, there is no need to find special accommodation. Any one interested in applying can get their contact information through their website \textit{"https://dawnaerospace.com"}.
