\chapter{Background DAWN Aerospace}
Dawn Aerospace is an aerospace company located in Delft, the Netherlands. Dawn Aerospace
specializes in the design, construction and operation of aerospace propulsion and rocket systems.
Currently, Dawn Aerospace is developing a new class of long-life reusable vehicles for high frequency
"gas and go" suborbital access and hypersonic research. As a first step, Dawn Aerospace will develop
a Suborbital Research Vehicle. This vehicle would need to be horizontal take-off and landing (HTHL)
with a sufficient L/D ratio such that reasonable aerodynamic flight characteristics can be achieved,
similar to a high-performance jet.

As a precursor to the suborbital research vehicle, a small rocket powered flying testbed has been
developed. The flying testbed is an autonomous fixed wing UAV powered by a reusable liquid rocket
engine. The flying testbed is equipped by the Ardupilot based PixHawk autopilot system. A basic
hardware in the loop test setup has been developed, including a basic aerodynamic model of the
flying test bed, to support the development of avionics for future projects.
