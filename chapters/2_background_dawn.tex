\chapter{Background DAWN Aerospace}
Dawn Aerospace is an aerospace company located in Delft, the Netherlands and specializes in the design, construction and operation of aerospace propulsion and rocket systems. Currently a new class of long-life reusable vehicles for high frequency "gas and go" suborbital access and hypersonic research is being developed. As a first step, Dawn Aerospace will develop a Suborbital Research Vehicle. This vehicle would need to be horizontal take-off and landing (HTHL) with a sufficient L/D ratio such that reasonable aerodynamic flight characteristics can be achieved, similar to a high-performance jet. \\

As a precursor to the suborbital research vehicle, a small rocket powered fixed wing UAV has been
developed. This vehicle serves as a testbed onto which new anf future technologies can be tested.
